# Cyberbullying-detector
This project is a cyberbullying detection tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify user comments as either hate speech, insults, threats, or other categories. It leverages a machine learning model trained on labeled text data to identify harmful language and provide feedback on the nature of the comment.
